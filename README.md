#### Data Formats

- Audio is stored as `.wav` files where each experiment is stored in a serperate folder with microphones i recording stored as `Track i.wav`
- Detections are stored as `<experiment name>.npy` with the stored array being a 2D matrix where each row is a detection and each column has the following information `<mic 1 index>, <mic 2 index>, <time t from start of recording>, <tdoa-detection (i.e. d_ijt = |s(t) - r_2| - |s(t) - r_1|)>`
