Baseline-system results (on tdoa_20201016):

Basline-system:
detector - gcc-phat detector with 10000 samples chunks skipping frequencies over approx 3500 hz
tdoa_vector - "tdoa_matrix_to_tdoa_vector.py" minimal spanning tree ransac + reestimation
position - matlab system

Succeds (converges) on:
- music_0011
- music_0012
- music_0013 (for first half (ground truth breaks after 50 seconds))
- music_0014
- music_0015

doesn't converge on the rest of the experiments.

When converging we have approx 5-15 cm error for sender in 3d position.
